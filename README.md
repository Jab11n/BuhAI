# BuhAI
Silly discord bot that responds to messages using GPT-2.  
GPT-2 is very old and it's basically nonsensical, and that's what makes it fun.
## Configuration
Install requirements:
* Make sure you have the latest version of Python and Pip
* In a new virtual environment: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

In `buh.py`:
* add any words you'd like it not to say to the `bad_words` list, (it's very spontaneous and unfiltered so I'd recommend doing that)
* set the temperature to something from 0.7 (calm) to 1.0 (very random). I recommend 0.9,
* add your bot token (make sure to keep this private!)  
Run buh.py and ping your bot with a short message!
